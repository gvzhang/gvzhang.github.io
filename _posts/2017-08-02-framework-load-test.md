### 系统配置
- 虚拟机 2核 4G
- 主机ab压测虚拟机

### OpenResty
#### 测试代码
```nginx
server {
   #监听端口，若你的6699端口已经被占用，则需要修改
    listen 80;
    server_name openresty.test;
    location / {
        default_type text/html;

        content_by_lua '
            ngx.say("<p>hello, world</p>")
        ';
    }
}

#### 注意
- 单一逻辑抛出异常，整个调度会 
- 连续多次的`ab -n 10000 -c 100 192.168.10.10:8110/`情况下，并发效率会变得很慢。为什么呢？？？

### Swoole原生
#### 测试代码
```php
$http = new swoole_http_server('0.0.0.0', 9501);

$http->on('request', function ($request, $response) {
    $resultEnd = "hello swoole";
    $response->header('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');
    $response->end($resultEnd);
});

$http->start();
```
